Most animals' fur grows downward, which assists in water runoff. However, sloths' fur grows upward, even when they are hanging upside down. This unique growth direction allows rainwater to be directed off the sloth's body, aiding in quicker drying. Also there is another purpose of sloth fur. Each strand of fur possesses grooves that collect algae. As a result, the sloth's fur acquires a greenish color, enabling it to blend in with its leafy environment.

Earlier events are positioned to the left, while later events are positioned to the right.\n\nFirstly, we observe that the event \"Romeo fights with Tybalt\" is situated to the left of \"Romeo and Juliet plan to run away.\" This indicates that the event of Romeo fighting with Tybalt occurs before their plan to run away.\n\nNow, we need to establish the connection between the event \"Romeo fights with Tybalt\" and the given options. None of the options specifically mention this event, so we need to evaluate their relevance based on the context.\n\nAnalyzing option A, \"He makes a plan with Juliet to run away,\" we can infer that this event could likely take place after Romeo fights with Tybalt. This suggests that option A is a possible continuation of events.\n\nOn the other hand, option B, \"He meets Juliet at the ball,\" does not have a clear connection to the event of Romeo fighting with Tybalt. Therefore, option B seems less likely to be the correct choice.\n\nConsequently, based on the analysis of the time line and the contextual connections, we can determine that option A, \"He makes a plan with Juliet to run away,\" is the most reasonable answer.\n\nIn summary, the step-by-step analysis is as follows:\n1. Examine the given options: Option A and Option B.\n2. Observe the time line and understand its chronological arrangement.\n3. Identify the event \"Romeo fights with Tybalt\" on the time line.\n4.

To determine the number of Punnett square boxes representing offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, we need to consider the dominance or recessiveness of each phenotype for the coat color trait.\n2. According to the given information, the L allele is dominant for a black coat, while the l allele is recessive for a reddish-brown coat.\n3. A reddish-brown coat is the recessive version of the coat color trait, implying that an offspring with this coat color must have two recessive alleles (ll) for the coat color gene.\n4. In the Punnett square, we identify 2 boxes indicating the genotype ll, representing offspring with a reddish-brown coat.\n5. On the other hand, a black coat is the dominant version of the coat color trait, meaning that an offspring with this coat color must have at least one dominant allele (LL or Ll) for the coat color gene.\n6. In the Punnett square, we highlight 2 boxes representing the genotype LL or Ll, representing offspring with a black coat.\n7. Therefore, based on the Punnett square analysis, the expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat is 2:2.\n8.
